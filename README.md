DEMO project with node server + Java API.

The node server will serve index.html and use the Bazel dev server as a CDN to load the demo Angular application.

Requests are proxied through the node app to a Java Api. 

Test it out:

Start the project by running npm run start

Access the application on http://localhost:7777
